## Description
This project is an interactive front-end webpage that utilizes a GIPHY API and Pokemon API.

It emphasizes the use of JavaScript, Bootstrap, and jQuery.

When the user searches a Pokemon name in the search box, they are presented with an image of the searched Pokemon, selected information, a variety of GIPHS, and a list of the Pokemon it evolves to and from.  

The application also utilizes local storage to store the users recent searches.
